## Usage

### Setting Up the Pipeline

Follow these steps to set up your Git pipeline:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Remote Repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Create and Switch to a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

4. **Stage and Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. **Push Changes to Remote Repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

### Pipeline Stages

The basic Git pipeline consists of several key stages:

1. **Working Directory:** Where you make changes to your files.
2. **Staging Area:** Where you prepare changes for the next commit.
3. **Local Repository:** Where commits are stored locally.
4. **Remote Repository:** Where commits are pushed to a shared repository.

## Best Practices

- **Commit Often:** Make small, frequent commits to keep your changes manageable.
- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:** Clearly describe what each commit does.
- **Use Branches:** Create branches for new features, bug fixes, and experiments.
- **Merge Regularly:** Keep your branches up-to-date with the main branch to avoid conflicts.
- **Review Code:** Use pull requests to review and discuss changes before merging.
